# Tic-Tac-Toe

A two-player game played on a 3x3 grid where one uses Blue and the other Red crayons. Players take turns coloring squares to complete a row of their color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The goal is to be the first to create a full row while blocking the opponent's attempts. It's a quick, strategic game requiring critical thinking and tactics to win!
